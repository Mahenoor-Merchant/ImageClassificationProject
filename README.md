# Image Classification: Computer Vision Project

Welcome to the Image Classification project, where images of cats and dogs are classified using transfer learning from the VGG16 model.

## Overview

In this project, transfer learning techniques are leveraged, specifically utilizing the pre-trained VGG16 model, to classify images of cats and dogs. Transfer learning allows for benefiting from the knowledge acquired by the VGG16 model while training on a large dataset like ImageNet, enabling accurate classifications even with a relatively small dataset.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:
